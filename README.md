* Prompt Template: A template for formatting the input to the model.  
* Output Parser: Processes and formats the model's output for downstream use.  
* Chain: A sequence of operations involving models and tools.  
* Agent: An autonomous entity that interacts with its environment based on model outputs.  
* Retrieval: The process of retrieving relevant information to assist in model tasks.
